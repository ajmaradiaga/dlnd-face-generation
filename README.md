# DLND-Face Generation

In this project, I use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) to generate new images of faces. More information about DCGANs can be found in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).

## Dataset

[CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is the dataset used in the project to train the DCGAN. This dataset was created by the [Multimedia Laboratory](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
